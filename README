This is in the very early stages of development and should be considered
experimental.

h1. Getting it running
To get things up and running simply run the server.py Python script:

$ ./server.py

And visit http://localhost:4000/

h1. Developing

The entry point for the code is src/main.js

More documentation is coming when the framework is in a more usable state.

h1. Browser Support

I intend for this to work in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE9. I
mostly develop using Chrome so that's likely to have the best compatibility
until I get close to an alpha quality build.
