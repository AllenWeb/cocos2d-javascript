Check the LICENSE file licensing details.

This is in the early stages of development and could break backwards compatibility at any time.

Example Code
------------

If you want a very basic example and a good starting point then you should checkout
<https://github.com/RyanWilliams/cocos2d-helloworld>

Getting things running
----------------------

To get things up and running simply run the development web server

    $ ./cocos server

And visit <http://localhost:4000/>. You will see a selection of tests you can run.

Developing
----------

Everything you write will be in separate JavaScript files. These will be
compiled into a single file which also includes all your other resources
including images, sound files, map files, etc.

The entry point for the code is path defined as "main.js" inside the in "make.js" file.

In the public/index.html you will see &lt;script src="cocos2d.js"&gt; tag to include the code.

The development web server will compile your code each time it is
requested. This makes development a lot easier.

Run ./cocos server -h for help.

More documentation is coming when the framework is in a more usable state.

Compiling your app
------------------

To compile your code you run ./cocos make. Which reads the make.js file
to work out what you want to build.

When built the resulting .js file will contain all your code aswell as all your
images and map files. This means you only need to update a single file and only
a single HTTP request is needed to serve everything.

Run ./cocos make -h for help.

Browser Support
---------------

I intend for this to work in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE9. I
mostly develop using Chrome so that's likely to have the best compatibility
until I get close to a proper release.

Documentation
-------------

Download JsDoc 2.3 (or 2.4) from <http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/>.

Copy that to /usr/local/jsdoc-toolkit or wherever you like and then run:
    
    java -jar /usr/local/jsdoc-toolkit/jsrun.jar /usr/local/jsdoc-toolkit/app/run.js -t=/usr/local/jsdoc-toolkit/templates/jsdoc -d=./jsdocs/ -r 10 src/

The documentation will appear in the jsdocs directory.
